This is a very basic text editor. Here are some ideas for extending its functionality:

Allow editing specific lines in the file.
Implement delete and search functionalities.
Add support for saving changes to a new file.
Handle larger files efficiently by using dynamic memory allocation instead of fixed-size buffers.

How to Compile and Run:
Save the code to a file, say text_editor.c.
Compile the code using a C compiler, for example:

gcc -o text_editor text_editor.c
Run the compiled program:

./text_editor
